<h2> Awais' Professional Goals: </h2>
<p style="font-family: verdana"> As of now I aim to graduate with my Bachelor's degree in Information Science but eventually I want to be able to use this degree in the field of business and finance. <br><br>
I originally wanted to become a counselor but now with an ever-changing world, I believe I can achieve this dream with better efficiency and more success than with simply a business degree.       </p>
